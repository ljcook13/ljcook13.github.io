        <p class="writing2"> This webpage shows the rule of thirds because you can see 3 pictures really dominating on the top of the page and then the explanation of what it means underneath. There is definitely a specific point that they wanted you to focus on. They also used this same rule within there logo so that people know what to look at.</p>

        <p class="writing3"> This webpage shows that there aren't many options to choose from within their store. Therefore, there are only a few options for the customer to make a choice on what to buy. They first ask you how big of a box you want and then they only have about six or seven cookies to choose from to put in the box. This makes it really easy to use for customers.</p>
