        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <li><a href="https://www.rachaelrayshow.com/category/healthy-living">Rachael Ray Cooking Show</a></li> 
        <img src="/CIT230/lesson2/images/RachaelRay.PNG" alt="Rachael Ray's Cooking Show">
        <li>This webpage shows the food that Rachael Ray cooks for her healthy lifestyle. You can see here that every peice of her dish is the most important and the recipe stands out the most. Each peice of the "puzzle" is as equally as important as the next thing.</li> 
        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <li><a href="https://biz.dominos.com/">Domino's Pizza</a></li>
        <img src="/CIT230/lesson2/images/Domino's.PNG" alt="Domino's Pizza">
        <li>This webpage shows the rule of thirds because you can see 3 pictures really dominating on the top of the page and then the explanation of what it means underneath. There is definitely a specific point that they wanted you to focus on. They also used this same rule within there logo so that people know what to look at.</li>
        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <li><a href="https://www.thecookieplace.co/shop/">The Cookie Place</a></li>
        <img src="/CIT230/lesson2/images/CookiePlace.PNG" alt="The Cookie Place">
        <li>This webpage shows that there aren't many options to choose from within their store. Therefore, there are only a few options for the customer to make a choice on what to buy. They first ask you how big of a box you want and then they only have about six or seven cookies to choose from to put in the box. This makes it really easy to use for customers.</li>
