                    <h2>Five Scenarios</h2>
                        <p>Patricia is about what to wear to school today and this website will do the job of telling her what she needs to wear for the day.</p>
                        <p>Jason is about to fly across the globe from California to China and wants to know what the weather will be like when he lands so he can dress appropriately on the plane.</p>
                        <p>Patricia is about to go on a date and she wants to go without a jacket but doesn't know if the weather will allow her to. She jumps on Weather Mania so that she can make an informed decision on what to do.</p>
                        <p>Jason wants to go on a run but doesn't know whether to go inside or outside. Weather Mania informs him that is it too cold to run outside so he should stick with a treadmill.</p>
                        <p>Jason's family is coming into town and they have planned to go swimming. Jason goes on Weather Mania and notices that it is going to rain on Saturday so it might not be the best day to swim.</p>
